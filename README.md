## Why We Make PiSugar

In the last few months, we have been working on projects base on Pi zero. It always comes to my mind that why we choose this tiny thing, to build a new portable product.

We believe perfect size will completely change the way we think.
We also believe in delicacy and better experience, which are essential for electronic circuit board.

After trying a number of power supply solutions, we found that none of them is elegent enough.
So we decide make it by ourselves. 

We call it PiSugar PowerPack — a power module specially designed for raspberry pi zero/pi zero w.
